# Front-end using React and TypeScript - Interview submission for RocketTutor

This project was created using React and TypeScript to create a get request using the MOCK_DATA.json file
created as a mock API. The promise-based HTTP client Axios is used to create the mock API and make a GET request on this.
React Hooks are used to handle the request.

After execution, on the localhost [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) or [http://localhost:3000/mock](http://localhost:3000/mock),
data will get rendered as a Table component, which was implemented and designed using React MaterialUI, which is a React component library.

Users can sort all the instances by just clicking the arrow icon (next to the Time column) to sort the list ascending or descending by
the Time column as expected. Refreshing the page, will again render the data with the non-sorted version.

For your interest, during my development project, this was first implemented fully in JavaScript and converted to TypeScript by
adding corresponding type annotations. This was a learning process of TypeScript, so I might forgot some type
declerations. All packages used can be found in the following JSON file:

### `typescript-app/package.json`

## Execution

Make sure you have installed the Node.js and npm

### npm install

Move to the project directory:

### `cd typescript-app`

Then execute the following command to start the project:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) or [http://localhost:3000/mock](http://localhost:3000/mock) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
